To avoid long cells of codes in the notebook, you can also embed long python functions and classes in a separate module. Donâ€™t forget to hand in your module if that is the case. In multiple exercises, you are required to come up with your own method to solve various problems. Be creative and clearly motivate and explain your methods.
